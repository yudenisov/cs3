Contacts Storage v.3.0
=========

Convenient system for storing your contacts

  - All contacts are always available
  - It is easy to find the right person by name, phone number and even a note by pressing F5
  - You do not depend on third-party services
  - It's free


> After closing the Google reader I stopped trusting the service side, and lose important phone numbers and email I did not want, so created this system
